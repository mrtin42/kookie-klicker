# clicker of cookies

this is a simple game where you click a cookie. i was really bored so my simultaneously stupid and genius friend said i should make this so props to him. turns out it was a pretty good test of my client side javascript skills. also turned out to be my last actual project made in raw html, css and js. i have since moved on to next.js, react, node.js, all that bollocks. but im keeping this for archival purposes. you can play it [here](https://koolkookieklicker.mrtin.co)
